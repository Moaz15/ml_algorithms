#  Logistic Regression with L2 Regularization – Full Mathematical Derivation 
#  1. Problem Statement

We are solving a **binary classification** problem.  
Given:
- Input vector: x ∈ ℝⁿ
- Output label: y ∈ {0, 1}

Our goal is to learn a function that estimates the probability:
P(y = 1 | x)

---
## 🔢 2. Hypothesis Function (Sigmoid)
We start with a linear function:

z = θᵀx + b
To map the real-valued output into a probability, we use the **sigmoid function**:

σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(−z))

So our predicted probability is:

ŷ = hθ(x) = σ(θᵀx + b)

---

##  3. Interpreting the Output
- ŷ = P(y = 1 | x)
- 1 − ŷ = P(y = 0 | x)

---

## 📉 4. Loss Function: Binary Cross Entropy
We use cross-entropy to measure the mismatch between predicted probability and true label.

For one example:

L(ŷ, y) = −[y log(ŷ) + (1 − y) log(1 − ŷ)]

For all m examples:

J(θ) = −(1/m) ∑ [yᵢ log(ŷᵢ) + (1 − yᵢ) log(1 − ŷᵢ)]

---

##  5. The Overfitting Problem
Without any constraint on θ, the model can assign **very large weights** to fit training data perfectly — even on noise.  
This causes **overfitting**, leading to **high variance** and poor generalization.

---

##  6. Adding L2 Regularization
To prevent large weights, we add an L2 penalty:

J(θ) = CrossEntropyLoss + (λ / 2m) ∑ θⱼ²

Where:
- λ: regularization strength
- Bias b is **not penalized**

---

##  7. Gradient Derivation with Regularization

Let:

error = ŷ − y

Then:

**Gradient of loss w.r.t. weights:**

∂J/∂θ = (1/m) Xᵀ(error) + (λ/m) θ

**Gradient of loss w.r.t. bias:**

∂J/∂b = (1/m) ∑ (ŷᵢ − yᵢ)

---

##  8. Parameter Update Rules (Gradient Descent)

θ := θ − α [(1/m) Xᵀ(error) + (λ/m) θ]  
b := b − α (1/m) ∑ (ŷᵢ − yᵢ)

Where:
- α: learning rate

---

##  9. Final Objective Function

J(θ) = −(1/m) ∑ [yᵢ log(ŷᵢ) + (1 − yᵢ) log(1 − ŷᵢ)] + (λ / 2m) ∑ θⱼ²

---

#  10. Summary
- Logistic regression predicts P(y = 1 | x) using the sigmoid of a linear combination.
- Cross-entropy loss penalizes incorrect probabilities.
- L2 regularization keeps weights small to reduce overfitting.
- Model is trained using gradient descent with regularized gradients.
- The final model is simple, robust, and interpretable.

You’ve now fully derived logistic regression with L2 regularization — end to end!
